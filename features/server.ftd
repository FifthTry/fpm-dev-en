-- my-ds.page: `fastn` Server

`fastn` can act as an HTTP server as well. Using `fastn` server is an
alterantive to using [`fastn` static site generator](/static/).

If a `fastn` package is using `fastn` server, then it has access to more dynamic
features.

- [`http` etc processor](/http/) is executed on page load time
- [`get-data`](/processors/get-data/) has access to request parameters
