`fastn` can act as an HTTP server as well. Using `fastn` server is an
alterantive to using [`fastn` static site generator](/static/). If you want
your webpages to be dynamic, regenerated on every request, you will have to
deploy `fastn` binary on a server.

If you created your `fastn` package using the
[fastn-template](https://github.com/fastn-stack/fastn-template) repository then
you will see a button in README to deploy your package on Heroku.
