-- ds.h1: `ftd` for authoring prose

`ftd` is a DSL for authoring long for text, and have access to
rich collection of ready made components.


-- ds.code: writing single or multi line text is easy
lang: ftd

\-- amitu: Hello World! ðŸ˜€

\-- ds.markdown:

some markdown text!

\-- amitu:

you can also write multiline messages easily!

no quotes. and **markdown** is *supported*.





-- amitu: Hello World! ðŸ˜€

-- ds.markdown:

some markdown text!

-- amitu:

you can also write multiline messages easily!

no quotes. and **markdown** is *supported*.


-- ds.markdown:

Note: These are not built in components of ftd, but are using [open source
component libraries](/featured/), eg
[fifthtry.github.io/bling/quote](https://fifthtry.github.io/bling/chat/). Learn
how to [build your own](/expander/).

-- ds.code: using little more complex components
lang: ftd


\-- import: fifthtry.github.io/bling/quote

The web has lost some of the exuberance from the
early 2000s, and it makes me a little sad.

-- ds.markdown:

There are [many components to chose
from](https://fifthtry.github.io/bling/quote/), and you can create your own
with ease.

-- ds.h1: A language for building UI

`ftd` comes with basic building blocks like text, images and containers using
with other UI can be constructed.

-- ds.code: Creating a custom component
lang: ftd

\-- component toggle-text:
boolean $current: false
caption title:

\-- ftd.text: $toggle-text.title
align-self: center
text-align: center
color if { toggle-text.current }: #D42D42
color: $inherited.colors.cta-primary.text
background.solid: $inherited.colors.cta-primary.base
$on-click$: $ftd.toggle($a = $toggle-text.current)
border-radius.px: 5

\-- end: toggle-text

\-- toggle-text: `ftd` is cool!

-- ds.output:

-- toggle-text: click me to toggle colors

-- end: ds.output



-- ds.markdown:


With `ftd`, you can express your ideas and bring them to a compilation with
ease.

Take a look at this simple `ftd` document:

-- ds.code: `ftd` Hello World!
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.text: Hello World!

-- ds.markdown:

The above code would show `Hello World` as output.

With just a few lines of code, you can create a visually appealing and impactful
document. It is a language that is easy to read and understand. It is not
verbose like HTML, and not simplistic like Markdown.

`ftd` can be compared with Markdown, but with `ftd`, you can define variables,
perform event handling, abstract out logic into custom components etc.

-- ds.h2: How to use `ftd`?

`ftd` can be used using [`fastn`](/) which provides interface for `ftd`.
You need to install fastn to get started.

Here are some of the important `fastn` related links.

- [Introducing `fastn`](/)
- [Install `fastn`](/install/)


-- ds.h2: Declaring Variable

In `ftd`, you can create variables with specific types. `ftd` is a
strongly-typed language, so the type of each variable must be declared.

Here's an example of how you can define a boolean type variable:

-- ds.code: Defining Variable
lang: ftd

\-- boolean flag: true

-- ds.markdown:

In this code, we're creating a variable named `flag` of `boolean` type. The
variable is defined as immutable, meaning its value cannot be altered. If you
want to define a mutable variable, simply add a `$` symbol before the variable
name.

Consider this example which has a mutable variable declaration `flag`.

-- ds.code: Defining Variable
lang: ftd

\-- boolean $flag: true

-- ds.markdown:

To know more about variables checkout [variables](/variables/).


-- ds.h2: Event handling

`ftd` makes it easy to add events to your element. Let's take a look at the
following example:


-- ftd.row:
width: fill-container
spacing.fixed.px: 50

-- ds.code: `ftd.text` kernel component
lang: ftd

\-- boolean $current: true

\-- ftd.text: Hello World!
align-self: center
text-align: center
padding.px: 20
color if { current }: #D42D42
color: $inherited.colors.cta-primary.text
background.solid: $inherited.colors.cta-primary.base
$on-click$: $ftd.toggle($a = $current)

-- toggle-text: Hello World!

-- end: ftd.row


-- ds.markdown:

Since the target audience for `ftd` is human beings, it includes many "default
functions" that are commonly used, like the `toggle` function which can be used
to create simple event handling.

-- ds.h2: Creating a custom component

In `ftd`, you can create custom components to abstract out logic and improve
code organization. For example:

-- ftd.row:
width: fill-container
spacing.fixed.px: 50

-- ds.code: Creating a custom component
lang: ftd

\-- component toggle-text:
boolean $current: false
caption title:

\-- ftd.text: $toggle-text.title
align-self: center
text-align: center
color if { toggle-text.current }: #D42D42
color: $inherited.colors.cta-primary.text
background.solid: $inherited.colors.cta-primary.base
$on-click$: $ftd.toggle($a = $toggle-text.current)

\-- end: toggle-text

\-- toggle-text: `ftd` is cool!


-- toggle-text: `ftd` is cool!

-- end: ftd.row


-- ds.markdown:

Here we have created a new component called `toggle-text`, and then instantiated
it instead. This way you can create custom component library and use them in our
writing without "polluting" the prose with noise.

-- ds.h2: Import

`ftd` allows you to separate component and variable definitions into different
modules, and then use them in any module by using the `import` keyword. This
helps to logically organize your code and avoid complexity, leading to cleaner
and easier to understand code.

Consider the below example:

-- ds.code: `ftd` Hello World!
lang: ftd

\-- import: lib

\-- lib.h1: Hello World

-- ds.markdown:

The code above shows a `ftd` document that imports a library named "`lib`" and
has a level 1 heading of "Hello World".


-- ds.h2: Data Modelling

`ftd` is also a good first class data language. You can define and use records:

-- ds.code: Data Modelling in `ftd`
lang: ftd

\-- record person:
caption name:
string location:
optional body bio:

-- ds.markdown:

Each field has a type. `caption` is an alias for `string`, and tells ftd that
the value can come in the "caption" position, after the `:` of the "section line",
eg: lines that start with `--`. If a field is optional, it must be marked as
such.

-- ds.code: Creating a variable
lang: ftd

\-- person amitu: Amit Upadhyay
location: Bangalore, India

Amit is the founder and CEO of FifthTry.

He loves to code, and is pursuing his childhood goal of
becoming a professional starer of the trees.

-- ds.markdown:

Here we have defined a variable `amitu`. You can also define a list:

-- ds.code: Creating a list
lang: ftd

\-- person list employees:

\-- person: Sourabh Garg
location: Ranchi, India

\-- person: Arpita Jaiswal
location: Lucknow, India

Arpita is the primary author of `ftd` language.

\-- end: employees

-- ds.markdown:

`ftd` provides a way to create a component that can render records and loop
through lists to display all members of the list:

-- ds.code: Looping over a list
lang: ftd

\-- render-person:
person: $p
$loop$: $employees as $p

-- ds.markdown:

This way we can have clean separation of data from presentation. The data
defined in `ftd` documents can be easily read from say Rust:

-- ds.code: Reading Data from `ftd` files
lang: rs

#[derive(serde::Deserialize)]
struct Employee {
    name: String,
    location: String,
    bio: Option<String>
}

let doc = ftd::p2::Document::from("some/id", source, lib)?;
let amitu: Employee = doc.get("amitu")?;
let employees: Vec<Employee> = doc.get("employees")?;


-- ds.markdown:

As mentioned earlier, `ftd` is a first-class data language that provides a
better alternative to sharing data through CSV or JSON files. Unlike CSV/JSON,
in `ftd`, data is type-checked, and it offers a proper presentation of the data
with the option to define components that can render the data, which can be
viewed in a browser.

Furthermore, `ftd` can also serve as a language for configuration purposes.


-- ds.h1: Getting Involved

We are trying to create the language for human beings and we do not believe it
would be possible without your support. We would love to hear from you.
