-- ft.h0: `fpm` Usage

`fpm` CLI uses a few sub-commands to do different things:

- `fpm -h` or `fpm --help` to print help-text and exit.
- [`fpm build`](/fpm/build/)
- [`fpm sync`](/fpm/sync/)

Running `fpm` without any argument prints the help-text, which lists all available
subcommands and general instructions on how to use `fpm`.
