-- ft.h0: `fastn sync`

`fastn sync` operates in two modes. If the package is hosted on `fastn-repo` then it
syncs the content of local folder with remote [not yet implemented]. If the package
is hosted on `github` etc, then `sync` creates a snapshot of modified files in
`.history` folder.

-- ft.markdown:

`fastn sync` first reports the repo of the package name, if its `github` it says
its `directly syncing with .history`.

Then it lists all the files that have been modified and updated.
