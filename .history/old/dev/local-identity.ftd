-- my-ds.page: Local Identity for Testing

Since identity requires people to sign in, and that may happen via oauth etc,
local development can become a pain, so we use a local identity feature, only
for testing.

[How to Test Auth](/how-to/auth-testing/)

-- ds.h1: When Would This Feature Work

For safety this will only happen if fastn serve is listening on 127.0.0.1. Also
it will not happen if [HOST key feature](https://github.com/FifthTry/fastn/issues/204)
is being used.


-- ds.h1: How to Use Local Identities

This feature can be used on a per request basis using `identities` cookie, or
globally via `--identities` cli argument to `fastn serve`.

-- ds.h2: `identities` request cookie

If a cookie named `identity` is present as part of HTTP request, and contains
comma separated list of `email: amitu, github: amitu` identities, we will use
the cookie content as identities of current user.

-- ds.h2: `--identities` cli parameter

When launching fastn server we can also specify
`fastn serve --identities="email: amitu, github: amitu"`, if so every request will
be assumed to have this identity.

-- ds.h2: What to do if both are passed?

If the server started `--identities` and `identities` cookie is found, so we will
prefer cli `--identities` and ignore the cookie.
