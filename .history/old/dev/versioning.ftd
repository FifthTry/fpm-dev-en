-- my-ds.page: How Versioning Works

FASTN uses fallback based file tracking technique to implement versioning.

-- ds.h1: Versioning Happens At Project Level

Currently a package will either implement versioning or it will not.

If a project implements versioning, the top level of the project there would be
version folders.

Normal layout looks like this:

-- ds.code: Project Without Versioning
lang: txt

- package-folder
  - FASTN.ftd
  - index.ftd
  - foo.ftd

-- ds.markdown:

For a project with versioning enabled:

-- ds.code: Project With Versioning (foo.com package's content)
lang: txt

- package-folder
  - FASTN.ftd
  - v1/
    - index.ftd
    - foo.ftd
  - v2/
    - index.ftd

-- ds.markdown:

Notice that `foo.ftd` does not exist in `v2` folder, since it has not been
edited in v2.

-- ds.h2: `fastn.package`

`fastn.package` includes one more field `versioned` of boolean type with
default value as false. Set this field to true to enable versioning.

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- fastn.package: <package-name>
versioned: true



-- ds.h2: Versioning FASTN.ftd

No FASTN versioning. All versions will use same dependencies etc.


-- ds.h1: Package URLs

If foo.com implements versioning, and have content as shown above, we will have
URLs for each version, eg `foo.com/v1/` (corresponding to index.ftd),
`foo.com/v1/foo/, `foo.com/v2/` and `foo.com/v2/foo/` (even though there is no
`foo.ftd` in `v2` folder).

-- ds.h2: Top level URLs

Further the latest version's content would be reflected on top level, so we
have `foo.com/` and `foo.com/foo/`.

Top level URLs would use latest version as the canonical URL. NOT SURE ABOUT IT.


-- ds.h1: `base` URL

All urls in markdown etc should use only be partial urls, so eg if `index.ftd`
is talking about `foo.com/foo/` it should link to it using `foo/`.

If the project was `foo.com/bar`, the base URL is `/bar/`, and full URLs of the
files mentioned above would be `foo.com/bar/v1/`, `foo.com/bar/v1/foo/` and so
on, so when linking we `index.ftd` will continue to use `foo/` as path, and base
URL would be set to `/bar/v1/` etc, based on which file being built.


-- ds.h1: Version Dropdown

Version dropdown will show all versions. Latest version would be linked against
the version number, eg `foo.com/v2/` not `foo.com/` even though the two have
same content.


-- ds.h1: FASTN Variables

To assist themes with versioning we have the following fastn variables:



-- ds.h2: `ftd.toc-item list fastn.versions`

All version prefixes, eg `v1`, `v2`, and so on. The link will point to the
current document's URL in that version. If the current document is not present
in that version the link is not set.
