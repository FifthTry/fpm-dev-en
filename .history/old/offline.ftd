-- my-ds.page: `fastn`: Offline Sync

`fastn` comes with ability to "clone" any `fastn` package, and view and modify it
offline. We support *two way sync*, with first class conflict handling, so you
do not inadvertently overwrite changes done by others when syncing your changes
back online.

-- ds.h1: View Offline

With this feature, you can clone a package, and build/serve it on your local
machine. This is great keeping a copy of the site on your local machine for
access when you do not have internet connection.

-- ds.h1: Access Control

`offline` feature works only if you have proper access to the `fastn` package in
question. You can download a package only if the package owner have allowed you
read access to it.

-- ds.h1: Archive FASTN Sites

With offline feature it is possible to download the content of `fastn` powered
website for creating an offline archive. When you clone a site you get access
to it's entire history.


-- ds.h1: Use Your Own Editor

`fastn` comes with built in editor, but you may want to use your own editor
instead of `fastn`'s web based editor. There are a lot of very powerful and
feature rich editors available today, and with this feature fastn users can use
any of those editors, and are not limited to the built in editor.

-- ds.h1: Batch Modifications

Sometimes you want to make large modifications, maybe using some script. Being
able to bring the site content to your machine, make edits and upload it back to
the `fastn server` opens gates for many use cases, not possible with a purely
web based editor.
