-- ft.page: `fpm clone <url>`

Clones a [server project](glossary/sync/#server-project) into a newly created
directory which then becomes the [client](glossary/sync/#client-project).

After the clone, a [`fpm sync`](cli/sync/) will keep the client in sync with
server.

This default configuration is achieved by creating `.client-state` and take all
server-latest as an entry to the client [workspace](glossary/sync/#workspace).
