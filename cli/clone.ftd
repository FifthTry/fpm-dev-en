-- my-ds.page: `fastn clone <url>`

Clones a [remote project](glossary/#remote) into a newly created
directory which then becomes the [clone](glossary/#clone).

After the clone, a [`fastn sync`](cli/sync/) will keep the clone project in sync
with remote.

This default configuration is achieved by creating `.client-state` and take all
remote-manifest as an entry to the clone [workspace](glossary/#workspace).
