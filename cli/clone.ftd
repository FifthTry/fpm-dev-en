-- ft.page: `fpm clone <url>`

Clones a [remote project](glossary/#remote) into a newly created
directory which then becomes the [clone](glossary/#clone).

After the clone, a [`fpm sync`](cli/sync/) will keep the clone project in sync
with remote.

This default configuration is achieved by creating `.client-state` and take all
server-latest as an entry to the client [workspace](glossary/#workspace).
