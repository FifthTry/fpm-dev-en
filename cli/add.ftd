-- ft.page: `fpm add <file-name>`


This would create entry in workspace.ftd and only the files added would be
consider for sync.

-- ft.h1: `fpm add -/<cr-number>/<file-name>`

This command should check that a file in cr `-/<cr-number>/<file-name>` exists.

-- ft.code: `.client-workspace/workspace.ftd`
lang: ftd

\-- fpm.client-workspace: <file-name>
cr: <cr-number>


-- ft.h1:  Error handling

Adding a file that exists in latest history would suggest to use `fpm edit`
instead.
