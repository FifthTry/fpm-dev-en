-- ft.page: `fpm add <file-name>`


This would create entry in workspace.ftd and only the files added would be
consider for sync.

-- ft.h1: `fpm add <file-name> --cr <cr-number>`

This command will create a file in cr `-/<cr-number>/<file-name>`

-- ft.h1:  Error handling

Adding a file that exists in latest history would suggest to use `fpm edit`
instead.
