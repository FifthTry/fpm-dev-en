-- ft.page: `fpm edit <file-name> --cr <cr-number>`

This command works with cr number only, else it fails
This would create entry in workspace.ftd and only the files added would be
consider for sync.

This command will clone the file in cr directory `-/<cr-number>` and also
start tracking with the latest version.


-- ft.h1:  Error handling

If the file doesn't exist in the latest history then throw error
