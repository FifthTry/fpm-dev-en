-- ds.page: Built-in Types

-- ds.markdown: 

`ftd` comes with some built-in types. These types can be used to construct more
complex types like [`record`](/record/) and
[`or-type`](/or-type/).

-- ds.h1: `boolean`

This type is used to represent boolean values `true` and `false`.

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- boolean is-monday: true

-- ds.markdown:

This type can be "auto-detected" so it's not necessary to specify the type when
declaring a boolean variable.

-- ds.h1: `integer`

This is integer type, can be positive or negative.

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- integer number-of-days-in-a-week: 7

-- ds.markdown:

This type can be "auto-detected" so it's not necessary to specify the type when
declaring an integer variable.

-- ds.h1: `decimal`

This type is used to represent decimal numbers.

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- decimal pi: 3.14159

-- ds.markdown:

This type can be "auto-detected" so it's not necessary to specify the type when
declaring a decimal variable.

-- ds.h1: `string`

This is unicode string.

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- string message: hello world!

-- ds.code: a multi-line string
lang: ftd

\-- string message:

this is a multiline string.

can have any number of lines.

or long paragraph, if you have a long paragraph to write. it can
contain unicode characters in any ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∑‡§æ, or emojis, üíÅüëåüéçüòç.

-- ds.h1: `caption`

`caption` is a special type, it is an alias for `string`, but can not be used when
declaring a variable.

This type is used for `record`, `or-type` and `component` arguments.

If a `record` or `or-type` field, or `component` argument is defined as `caption`,
it can be passed in the "caption" location in `ftd::p1` "section".

-- ds.code: record with caption
lang: ftd

\-- record person:
caption name:

\-- person amitu: Amit Upadhyay

\-- person shobhit:
name: Shobhit Sharma

-- ds.markdown:

If something is specified as `caption`, it can come in the "caption" location, eg
in case of `amitu` var, or it can come as an explicit key, as in the declaration
of `shobhit` variable.

-- ds.h1: `body`

`body` is a special type, it is an alias for `string`, but can not be used when
declaring a variable.

This type is used for `record`, `or-type` and `component` arguments.

If a `record` or `or-type` field, or `component` argument is defined as `body`,
it can be passed in the "body" location in `ftd::p1` "section".

-- ds.code: record with body
lang: ftd

\-- record person:
name: caption
bio: body

\-- person amitu: Amit Upadhyay

this is single

or multi-line bio of Amit.

\-- person shobhit:
name: Shobhit Sharma
bio: or we can put things in "header"

-- ds.markdown:

If something is specified as `body`, it can come in the "body" location, eg in
case of `amitu` var, or it can come as an explicit key, as in the declaration of
`shobhit` variable.

-- ds.h1: `caption or body`

`caption or body` is a special type, it is an alias for `string`, but can not be
used when declaring a variable.

This type is used for `record`, `or-type` and `component` arguments.

If a `record` or `or-type` field, or `component` argument is defined as `caption
or body`, it can be passed in either the "caption" or "body" location in
`ftd::p1` "section".

-- ds.code: record with caption or body
lang: ftd

\-- record person:
caption or body name:

\-- person amitu: Amit Upadhyay

\-- person shobhit:
name: Shobhit Sharma

\-- person abrar:

Abrar Khan

-- ds.markdown:

If something is specified as `caption or body`, it can come in the "caption"
location, eg in case of `amitu` var, or it can come as an explicit key, as in
the declaration of `shobhit` variable, or in "body" location, eg for `abrar`.


-- ds.h1: `ftd.color`

It is record type with the following fields.

-- ds.code: `ftd.color` record (ftd.ftd)
lang: ftd

\-- record color:
caption light:
string dark:

-- ds.markdown:

It shows color in light field in light mode and color in dark field in dark mode.
Consider the following example:

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.color red-orange:
light: red
dark: orange

-- ds.markdown:

This would return `red` color in light mode and `orange` color in dark mode.

-- ds.h2: Supported Color Formats

The value of `light` and `dark` can be any string supported by [CSS3 Color
spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-3/).

Along with CSS3 colors we also support 8 digit RGBA format (eg `#RRGGBBAA`) from
[CSS Color Module Level 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/).


-- ds.h1: `ftd.font-size`

It is record font-size with the following fields.

-- ds.code: `ftd.font-size` record (ftd.ftd)
lang: ftd

\-- record font-size:
integer line-height:
integer size:
integer letter-spacing:

-- ds.markdown:

It defines the line-height, size and letter-spacing.

-- ds.h2: `line-height`

The `line-height` field sets the height of a line box. It's commonly
used to set the distance between lines of text.

-- ds.h2: `size`

The `size` field sets the size of the font.

-- ds.h2: `letter-spacing`

The `letter-spacing` sets the horizontal spacing behavior between text
characters. This value is added to the natural spacing between characters
while rendering the text. Positive values of letter-spacing causes
characters to spread farther apart, while negative values of letter-spacing
bring characters closer together.

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.font-size fs:
line-height: 30
size: 24
letter-spacing: 0


-- ds.h1: `ftd.type`

It defines the typography of the font.

It is record type with the following fields.

-- ds.code: `ftd.type` record (ftd.ftd)
lang: ftd

\-- record type:
string font:
ftd.font-size desktop:
ftd.font-size mobile:
ftd.font-size xl:
integer weight:
optional string style:


-- ds.markdown:

It defines the:

- `font`: A prioritized list of one or more font family
  names and/or generic family names for the selected element.
- `desktop`, `mobile` and `xl`: These are of `ftd.font-size` type. These
  are responsive. So only one of these will be applicable depending on device.
- `weight`: The weight (or boldness) of the font.
- `style`: The appearance of decorative lines on text or styling of font. It is
  an optional field. It takes the following values: `italic`, `underline` and
  `strike`. More than one of these values can be using space separation.
  Example: `style: italic underline`


-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.font-size desktop-fs:
line-height: 30
size: 24
letter-spacing: 0

\-- ftd.font-size mobile-fs:
line-height: 20
size: 16
letter-spacing: 0

\-- ftd.font-size xl-fs:
line-height: 50
size: 46
letter-spacing: 0

\-- ftd.type font-type:
font: serif
desktop: $desktop-fs
mobile: $mobile-fs
xl: $xl-fs
weight: 400
style: italic

-- ds.markdown:

This would return `red` color in light mode and `orange` color in dark mode.


-- ds.h1: `length`

`length` is a type that is used for passing UI dimensions. It has one of the

`length` accepts following set of string:

- `fill`: This gives 100% space
- `auto`: This gives auto space (read more about it in `auto` css property value)
- `calc <some-value>`: It takes a single expression as its parameter, with the
   expression's result used as the value. Example: `width: calc 100% - 80px`
- `fit-content`: the element will use the available space, but never more than max-content.
   Example: `width: fit-content`
- `portion <integer>`: It specifies how much the item will grow relative to the
   rest of the items inside the same container.
- `percent <integer>`: This gives <integer>% space
- `vh <integer>`: Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport
- `vw <integer>`: Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport
- `<integer>`: Gives <integer>px unit space.
