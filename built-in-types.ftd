`ftd` comes with some built-in types. These types can be used to construct more
complex types like [`record`](/record/) and
[`or-type`](/or-type/).

-- ft.h1: `boolean`

This type is used to represent boolean values `true` and `false`.

-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- boolean is-monday: true

-- ft.markdown:

This type can be "auto-detected" so it's not necessary to specify the type when
declaring a boolean variable.

-- ft.h1: `integer`

This is integer type, can be positive or negative.

-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- integer number-of-days-in-a-week: 7

-- ft.markdown:

This type can be "auto-detected" so it's not necessary to specify the type when
declaring an integer variable.

-- ft.h1: `decimal`

This type is used to represent decimal numbers.

-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- decimal pi: 3.14159

-- ft.markdown:

This type can be "auto-detected" so it's not necessary to specify the type when
declaring a decimal variable.

-- ft.h1: `string`

This is unicode string.

-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- string message: hello world!

-- ft.code: a multi-line string
lang: ftd

\-- string message:

this is a multiline string.

can have any number of lines.

or long paragraph, if you have a long paragraph to write. it can
contain unicode characters in any ‡§≠‡§æ‡§∑‡§æ, or emojis, üíÅüëåüéçüòç.

-- ft.h1: `caption`

`caption` is a special type, it is an alias for `string`, but can not be used when
declaring a variable.

This type is used for `record`, `or-type` and `component` arguments.

If a `record` or `or-type` field, or `component` argument is defined as `caption`,
it can be passed in the "caption" location in `ftd::p1` "section".

-- ft.code: record with caption
lang: ftd

\-- record person:
caption name:

\-- person amitu: Amit Upadhyay

\-- person shobhit:
name: Shobhit Sharma

-- ft.markdown:

If something is specified as `caption`, it can come in the "caption" location, eg
in case of `amitu` var, or it can come as an explicit key, as in the declaration
of `shobhit` variable.

-- ft.h1: `body`

`body` is a special type, it is an alias for `string`, but can not be used when
declaring a variable.

This type is used for `record`, `or-type` and `component` arguments.

If a `record` or `or-type` field, or `component` argument is defined as `body`,
it can be passed in the "body" location in `ftd::p1` "section".

-- ft.code: record with body
lang: ftd

\-- record person:
name: caption
bio: body

\-- person amitu: Amit Upadhyay

this is single

or multi-line bio of Amit.

\-- person shobhit:
name: Shobhit Sharma
bio: or we can put things in "header"

-- ft.markdown:

If something is specified as `body`, it can come in the "body" location, eg in
case of `amitu` var, or it can come as an explicit key, as in the declaration of
`shobhit` variable.

-- ft.h1: `caption or body`

`caption or body` is a special type, it is an alias for `string`, but can not be
used when declaring a variable.

This type is used for `record`, `or-type` and `component` arguments.

If a `record` or `or-type` field, or `component` argument is defined as `caption
or body`, it can be passed in either the "caption" or "body" location in
`ftd::p1` "section".

-- ft.code: record with caption or body
lang: ftd

\-- record person:
caption or body name:

\-- person amitu: Amit Upadhyay

\-- person shobhit:
name: Shobhit Sharma

\-- person abrar:

Abrar Khan

-- ft.markdown:

If something is specified as `caption or body`, it can come in the "caption"
location, eg in case of `amitu` var, or it can come as an explicit key, as in
the declaration of `shobhit` variable, or in "body" location, eg for `abrar`.


-- ft.h1: `ftd.color`

It is record type with the following fields.

-- ft.code: `ftd.color` record
lang: ftd

\-- record ftd.color:
caption light:
string dark:

-- ft.markdown:

It shows color in light field in light mode and color in dark field in dark mode.
Consider the following example:

-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.color red-orange:
light: red
dark: orange

-- ft.markdown:

This would return `red` color in light mode and `orange` color in dark mode.
