;; Audience: People considering using it for their team.

`ftd` is a programming language for building user interfaces and content centric
websites. `ftd` is easy to learn, especially for non programmers, but does not
compromise on what you can build with it.

`fastn` is a web-framework, a content management system, and an integrated
development environment for `ftd`. `fastn` is a webserver, and compiles `ftd`
to HTML/CSS/JS, and can be deployed on your server, or on `fastn cloud` by
FifthTry.

;; See also: [fastn for Website Builders](/cms/) | [ftd as first Programming
;; Language](/first/).

The quickest way to learn `fastn` is the [short video course we have created:
expander](https://fastn.com/expander/), it takes you through the basics.

Then checkout the [frontend](/frontend/) and [backend](/backend/) sections of
our documentation.


-- ds.h1: `ftd`: Programming Language For The Next Billion Programmers

`ftd` is designed with minimal and uniform syntax, and at first glance does not
even look like a programming language.

-- ds.code: No quotes for string, multi-line strings are easy
lang: ftd

\-- amitu: Hello World! ðŸ˜€

\-- amitu:

you can also write multiline messages easily!

no quotes. and **markdown** is *supported*.


-- ds.markdown:

We have called a "function" named "amitu" with "Hello World! ðŸ˜€" as input, yet
it does not feel technical.

This is what it produces:


-- ftd-index.amitu: Hello World! ðŸ˜€

-- ftd-index.amitu:

you can also write multiline messages easily!

no quotes. and **markdown** is *supported*.
