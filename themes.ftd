-- my-ds.page: About FASTN Themes


-- ds.markdown: 

When authoring content using FASTN, we maintain a {ds.highlight: separation of
content from presentation}. FTD comes with a few "kernel" UI components, using
them one can create any design or presentation. But using them directly is not
recommended when authoring content.

For this reason themes should be designed as separate FASTN package that are to be
used by content packages as a dependency. The content packages should not use
FTD kernel components, instead they should only use components defined by
the one or more themes they depend on.

-- ds.h1: Package Interface

Each package in FASTN exposes a bunch of "modules" (ftd documents in a package),
and each of those modules exposes some "symbols", e.g. record definitions,
variables, and components defined in that module.

{ds.highlight: The set of modules and symbols is called the package interface
of that package.}

Say there is a package for creating resume. Say it exposes components like:

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- resume.me: Amit {bold: Upadhyay}
total-experience: 18 years


\-- resume.degree: BTech, Mechanical Engineering
university: IIT-Bombay
graduation: 2003

\-- resume.job: CEO
company: FifthTry, Inc
industry: Developer Tools
start-date: 2020-August

\-- resume.role: CEO
start-date: 2020-August

-- ds.markdown:

This theme has defined a module named `resume` and `resume` exposes `.me`,
`.degree`, `.job` and so on.

Any theme that implements this interface must implement components with same
name.

-- ds.h1: Interchangeable Theme

The main goal for themes is for them to be interchangeable. Since a theme for
a blog can not be interchanged with a theme for resume or a book, we aim
interchangeable-ity at "package interface" level.

{ds.highlight: Every theme must target a well-known package-interface.} Once a
PI, package interface, has been picked, the theme must implement all the modules
and symbols of that PI.

In future the fact that a theme implements some PI would be declared in the
`FASTN.ftd` file for that theme:

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- import fastn:

\-- fastn.package: foo.github.io/some-theme
implements: fastn.dev/resume

-- ds.markdown:

{ds.highlight: `implements:` is not yet implemented.} Once it is implemented,
FASTN will ensure that all the modules and symbols exported by `fastn.dev/resume`
have corresponding compatible counterparts in `foo.github.io/some-theme`, else
it will fail to build the package.

Similarly, in future, when adding the dependency of `some-theme`, a `FASTN.ftd`
will be able to declare it is expecting it to implement some PI:

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- import fastn:

\-- fastn.package: amitu.github.io/resume
\-- fastn.dependency: foo.github.io/some-theme
implements: fastn.dev/resume

-- ds.markdown:

Here `amitu.github.io/resume` is a FASTN package that depends on
`foo.github.io/some-theme`. But since it has explicitly declared this dependency
`implements` `fastn.dev/resume`, only the modules and symbols exported by
`fastn.dev/resume` would be available on `foo.github.io/some-theme`.

The idea is that {ds.highlight: a theme package may implement more than what is
specified in the packages it implements.} A theme can provide extra modules or
symbols. But since `amitu.github.io/resume` has imported
`foo.github.io/some-theme` as `fastn.dev/resume`, when processing
`amitu.github.io/resume`, only the `fastn.dev/resume` modules and symbols would be
available, not the extra ones found on `foo.github.io/some-theme`.

If `amitu.github.io/resume` was interested in all the modules and symbols exported
by `foo.github.io/some-theme`, they can chose to not specify the `implements:`
directive in the FASTN.ftd file.
