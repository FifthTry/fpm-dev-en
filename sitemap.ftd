-- ft.page-with-toc: FPM Sitemap
toc: $config.themes-toc

"FPM Sitemap" is the name of a structure we recommend for sites. It is
optional, you can create any sitemap you want for your sites. FPM has
built in support for FPM Sitemap.

-- ds.h1: The Structure

A site should have "sections" on top level. Each section should ideally be
listed in the header of the site.

Each section should have one or more sub-sections. Sub-section should be listed
as second level navigation in the header of the site. Each sub-section has one
or more documents organised in a "table of content", and TOC should be shown
on the left.

In the UI we also have "Section/Sub Section" Nav. It automatically will show the
section name and sub-section name.

-- ds.h1: Sitemap "Language" And `$processor$`

FPM comes with a `$processor$` called "sitemap", which parses the site
structure as a string.

-- ds.code: Sitemap Example
lang: txt

# Section: section/url/

# If Section: Has A Colon In The Name
url: sectionURL

## Sub Section: sub/url/

## If Sub:
url: whatever

- ToC Item: toc/

-- ds.markdown:

The TOC parser is already written, we will reuse it.

-- ds.code: `$processor$` usage
lang: ftd

\-- fpm.sitemap:
$processor$: sitemap

# Section: section/url/

-- ds.h1: Missing Sub Section

If a TOC comes directly in a section the section would have a single anonymous
sub-section, and this sub-section would not be shown in UI. In UI people will
just see the section header and toc on left, no sub-section line.

-- ds.h1: SubSection Header Overrides

-- ds.code: `$processor$` usage
lang: ftd

\-- fpm.sitemap:
$processor$: sitemap

# Section: section/url/
heading: Heading To Be Shown In Side

-- ds.markdown:

In this case "Section" would be shown in the header, but "Heading To Be Shown
In Side" would be shown in the left side.

`heading` works for both section and sub-section.

-- ds.h1: URL Can Be A Reference

Any URL referred in the text could start with `$` and if so it is a variable
reference.

-- ds.h1: FPM Build Behaviour

If a document is not part of sitemap, it will be built as is built right
now. All documents that are part of sitemap are built in a special way.

FPM build will first parse the sitemap and build all the URLs that are
not part of it, and then in another pass build all the ones that are in it.

A document can appear in multiple places in sitemap, in that case we will
build one HTML file for each time a ftd document appears in sitemap.

Note: A document can appear only once in a single TOC?

FPM Special Variables: `current-section`, `current-sub-section` etc would be
set. Further, whichever TOC the document is being built for, wherever the
document appears in toc, the `toc-item.selected` is set to `true`.

-- ds.h1: Canonical URL

If a ftd document appears multiple times in sitemap, one of them would
be the canonical, the "main" URL. Eg if `foo.ftd` appears in s1 and s2, one of
them would have the URL `/foo/` and other will be `/foo/-/s1/`. Which one?

By default the canonical is picked based on first appearance. But in the
sitemap, at the bottom we can pick the canonical.

-- ds.code: `$processor$` usage
lang: ftd

\-- fpm.sitemap:

# section/url/
key: value

- foo/
  key: vale
- bar/
  - z/
    k: v

# Section 2: section-2/url/

- foo: foo/
  canonical: true


-- ds.markdown:

We have declared that `foo/` listed under `section-2/url/` is the canonical,
and the URL would not be "mangled". The url for `foo/` in "section/url/" would
be mangled to "foo/-/section/url/".

If `canonical` is not used, the first entry is considered canonical.

-- ds.h1: How Would Document Look Like With Sitemap

When not using sitemap, the `sections`, `sub-sections`, `toc` etc has
to be added to a document. Eg if document is `foo.ftd` it contains:

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- ft.page-with-toc: FPM Sitemap
toc: $config.themes-toc

-- ds.markdown:

With sitemap, these parameters have to be omitted:

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- ft.page-with-toc: FPM Sitemap

-- ds.markdown:

In this case the `fpm.sitemap` is be used from `config.ftd` file.

-- ds.h1: Special Variables

-- ds.h2: `fpm.info` record

The `fpm.info` record contains the metadata. This includes:
`page-title`, `section-title`, `subsection-title` and `toc-title`. Besides
this will also contains other metadata.

The record looks like this

-- ds.code: `info` record (fpm.ftd)
lang: ftd

-- record info:
optional string page-title:
optional string section-title:
optional string subsection-title:
optional string toc-title:


If `page-title` is specified, this will be use as the title of the page.
If `section-title` is specified, this will be use in section.
If `subsection-title` is specified, this will be use in subsection.
If `toc-title` is specified, this will be use in TOC.

-- ds.h1: Key Value Data in Sitemap

Document can use `get-data` processor to get value of any key specified in
the sitemap. Since a document would get rendered once for each occurrence
of the document in the sitemap, each occurrence can have different data
and the occurrence specific data would be returned by `get-data`.

The key value pair supports inheritance. This means that the key-value pair data
presents in section get passed to it's subsection and TOCs. Similarly, subsection
key value data get passed to TOCs. And also the parent TOC-item's key value data
get passed to its children TOC.

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

# section/url/
key1: value1
key2: value2

## subsection/url/
key3: value3

- toc/url/
key4: value4
    - childtoc/url/
    key5: value5

-- ds.markdown:

In the above example, the `section/url/` section have two key value data
`key1: value1` and `key2: value2`
The `subsection/url/` subsection have three key value data where two are
inherited from section. i.e. `key1: value1`, `key2: value2` and `key3:
value3`
The `toc/url/` toc item have four key value data, where three are inherited
from section and subsection. i.e. `key1: value1`, `key2: value2`, `key3: value3`
and `key4: value4`
The `childtoc/url/` toc item have five key value data, where four are inherited
from section, subsection and it's parent TOC. i.e. `key1: value1`, `key2: value2`,
`key3: value3`, `key4: value4` and `key5: value5`


-- ds.h1: `page-title` etc can be changed based on where they are in sitemap

Using the `get-data`, the title can be different:

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- boolean show-dev-info:
$processor$: get-data

\-- string page-title: The Normal Title

\-- page-title: The Dev Title
if: $show-dev-info

\-- ds.h0: $page-title

-- ds.code: sitemap
lang: ftd

\-- fpm.sitemap:

# Overview

- foo/

# Development

- foo/
show-dev-info: true
