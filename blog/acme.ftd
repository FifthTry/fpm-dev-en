Imagine ACME Inc., an illustrious startup, as the protagonist of our narrative.
With its [official website](https://acme.fastn.com/) powered by `fastn`, this
case study sheds light on how the entire ACME team evolved from decision-makers
to proactive implementers.

The tale begins with the ACME team engaged in a brief 30-minute training session
to learn how to maintain a fastn-powered website.

Let's explore individual tasks executed by the team members.

-- ds.h1: Revamping ACME's Look in a Blink

Ganesh, the Design Head, decided to give a fresh look for ACME's website to 
enhance the user experience. With newfound skills after the training session, 
he revamped the website with a **single line of code**. By
removing the `midnight storm` and introducing the `midnight rush` package as a 
fastn dependency in the `fastn.ftd` file, he updated the layout, colour scheme, 
and typography of the website.

-- ds.h1: Price Updates

The Business Team's insights from a recent meeting have prompted to modify the 
Pricing Plan values to enhance conversions. As a result, Harish, the Product
Manager, decided to bring down the price of the startup and Enterprise Plan. 
By editing the `pricing.ftd` and updating the existing prices with the new 
figures, he swiftly implemented the change. As the pricing plan is a 
**component-based design**, he only needed to adjust the relevant values.
