SEO is a on-going process instead of one-time optimization. With duration
URLs are changed, meta tags get outdated or data needs to be updated.
Therefore, conducting regular SEO audits to identify areas that can be improved
must be a practice to keep up the changing world.


-- ds.h1: How to buzz on Social Media

`Open-graph meta tags` (og-tags) is key to make your content more clickable,
shareable, and noticeable on social-media.

-- ds.h2: Open-graph Meta tags

`og-tags` take over the control of how URLs are displayed when shared on
social-media.

They are part of [Open Graph protocol](https://ogp.me/) that are used by social
media sites like Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter (unless there is a dedicated
twitter tag).

You can find these tags in the `<head>` section of your website.

-- ds.h2: Why are Open Graph tags important

In the midst of content flooded on the social media, your website needs to 
standout. People are more likely to see and click shared content with optimized 
OG tags because:

1. They make the content more eye-catching in the feeds
2. They tell people what the content is about at a glance
3. These tags help social media sites understand what the content is about, 
which can help increase your brand visibility through search.
