-- ft.page: `static`: Serve Static Files

`static` serves all the non `ftd` files. We guess the file type based on content
of the file using the [`infer` crate](/crate/deps/infer/).

We serve static files both from current package as well as from any of the
dependencies of the current package.

The static files from dependencies are downloaded only on demand, and cached in
`.packages` folder.

-- ft.h1: URL

The URL of the static files follow the pattern: `/-/<package-name>/file/name.jpg`.
