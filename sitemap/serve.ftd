-- ds.page: `serve`: Serve FTD Files

`serve` is responsible for serving all FTD files in the current package. `serve`
downloads the dependencies of the package on demand and caches them in
`.pacakges` folder.

On every HTTP request we re-render each `ftd` file.

-- ds.h1: URLs

The URL is derived based on the name of ftd or markdown files.

- `a/foo.ftd`: `/a/foo/`
- `a/index.ftd`: `/a/`
- `index.ftd`: `/`
