I was very skeptical about learning to write any syntax; I had never done any
coding before. But I decided to give it a shot and went through the videos.
Itâ€™s actually surprisingly simple; it doesn't feel like coding at all. It's
just like writing text in a text file, and you end up with a beautifully
designed website. Definitely the most productive and result-oriented activity
I've ever undertaken in a single afternoon.
