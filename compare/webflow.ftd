stunning web projects.

programming experience to grasp its functionalities swiftly.

-- ds.markdown: 

As evident, the language is effortlessly comprehensible to everyone. This 
fosters smooth collaboration among developers, designers, and content creators, 
ultimately boosting the efficiency of the entire project.

-- ds.h1: Separation of content and design

In Webflow, making changes to the content can inadvertently disrupt the 
design layout. This can result in constant adjustments and compromises, 
making the maintenance process cumbersome.

In fastn, you can effortlessly modify the content without impacting the design. 

-- ds.h1: GitHub Integration

fastn's version control is made possible through its integration with GitHub. 
Online website builders like Webflow, Wix, and Framer often lack version control 
features. (Webflow offers review product only in Enterprise Edition) 

Without version control, users might find themselves in a predicament 
if they accidentally delete or overwrite a crucial information in their 
website. 

-- ds.h2: Easy Collaboration

fastn's integration with GitHub streamlines teamwork by enabling multiple 
contributors to work simultaneously on different branches, making collaboration 
smooth and efficient.

version quickly.

-- ds.h2: Review and Approval

The integration with GitHub facilitates a streamlined review process. Users can 
create pull requests, allowing designated reviewers to assess the proposed 
changes.

to GitHub integration in fastn.

-- ds.h2: Open source Advantage

their developers.

hub for designers and frontend developers to submit their fastn packages for end 
users to discover and use.

-- ds.h1: Opinionated Design System

fastn comes with integrated design system. We've pre-made many design choices

roles to UI elements. A lot of color scheme and typography packages are

-- ds.h1: Why fastn is the best choice for your startup

-- ds.h2: Full Control

Relying heavily on a single platform can introduce risks, especially if that 
platform undergoes changes or disruptions.Websites built on Webflow are tightly 
linked to the platform. Users who later wish to migrate their sites to other 
platforms or hosting services might encounter compatibility issues and data 
transfer challenges.

With fastn, you retain full control and ownership. Your content and audience 
always belongs to you. fastn being open-source, ensures your content lives 
forever. 

-- ds.h2: Cost of Onwership

Webflow's pricing model could become costly as users add more features or their 
business scales. Over time, the cumulative costs might not be feasible for 
startups or small businesses with limited budgets.

fastn is free forever.

-- ds.h2: Self-hosting

Self-hosting reduces dependency on third-party platforms and hosting services. 
This not only lowers costs associated with subscription fees but also minimizes 
the risk of service disruptions or policy changes by external providers.

fastn's allows you to deploy your website on your server. The freedom to 
self-host provides control, customization, privacy, scalability, 
and reduced reliance on external platforms.
