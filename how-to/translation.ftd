-- ds.page: Step by Step guide to setup translation with `fpm`

-- ds.markdown: 

FPM provides a first class support for translations of the documents. A particular
package can either be a translation or have translations pointing to other 
packages. At the build time, we process your translations and generate metadata
for each and every page in the corresponding package to ensure you as the project
maintainer, have a complete idea about what is going on in your project.

A translation package keeps track of your documents and helps you keep the documents
in sync with each other.

A translation is a two way agreement between two packages.

-- ds.h1: Prerequisites

You'll need to set up two `fpm` packages to enable translation across the two of
them.

For this example, we'll be using `foo.com` and `bar.com` where `bar.com` is the 
translation of `foo.com`

`foo.com` = master
`bar.com` = translation

Please familiarize yourself with our [Translation Philosphy](translation-philosphy/)
to get acquainted with the terminologies used in the document

-- ds.h1: Setting up the `master` package

The `master` package needs to specify the language it's targetting. At the very
core, this is the bare minimum setting you'll require to enable the translations
for your `master` package

-- ds.code: foo.com/FPM.dsd
lang: dsd

\-- import: fpm

\-- fpm.package: foo.com
language: English

-- ds.markdown:

Let's create a few documents in this package which we're supposed to be translated.

-- ds.code:
lang: shell

\$/foo.com/> touch example{01..05}.dsd

-- ds.h2: `fpm sync`

`fpm sync` command allows you to synchronize your changes and create a snapshot
of the package at the current timestamp in the `.history` folder in the root 
directory of your package.

-- ds.code: `fpm sync` output
lang: shell

\$ /foo.com/> fpm sync

Repo for foo.com is github, directly syncing with .history.
FPM.dsd
example01.dsd
example02.dsd
example03.dsd
example04.dsd
example05.dsd

-- ds.markdown:

We can now push the code and deploy our package.

-- ds.h1: Setting up the `translation` package

The `translation` package must specify the `translation-of` package. Specifying 
this marks the current package as the `translation-of` of another package.

-- ds.code: bar.com/FPM.dsd
lang: dsd

\-- import: fpm

\-- fpm.package: bar.com
translation-of: foo.com
language: hi

-- ds.h2: Translate documents

Let's start by creating a few counter part documents in the `bar.com` package.

-- ds.code: Translation documents
lang: shell

\$/bar.com/> touch example{01..03}.dsd

-- ds.code: Translation status
lang: shell

\$/bar.com/> fpm translation-status

Never marked: FPM.dsd
Never marked: example01.md
Never marked: example02.dsd
Never marked: example03.dsd
Missing: example04.dsd
Missing: example05.dsd

-- ds.markdown:

The `fpm translation-status` command will give you a complete overview of the 
documents in the current package.

-- ds.h2: `fpm mark-upto-date`

You can invoke this command along with a module path to mark that particular 
document as `upto date` in the translation tree. Doing so will create a `track`
of your document at the current timestamp.

-- ds.code: Mark up to date
lang: shell

\$/bar.com/> fpm mark-upto-date example01.dsd

example01.dsd is now marked upto date

\$/bar.com/> fpm mark-upto-date example02.dsd

example02.dsd is now marked upto date

\$/bar.com/> fpm translation-status

Never marked: FPM.dsd
Up to date: example01.md
Up to date: example02.dsd
Never marked: example03.dsd
Missing: example04.dsd
Missing: example05.dsd

-- ds.h1: Accept official translations

While anyone can start a package as a translation candidate to your `master` package,
you get to decide what all packages act as **official** for your package.

The translation candidate repository(bar.com) can be marked an official 
translation of `foo.com` by mapping the the same in `foo.com/FPM.dsd` file along
with providing the name of the language the current package belongs to.

The translation

-- ds.code: foo.com/FPM.dsd
lang: dsd


\-- import: fpm

\-- fpm.package: foo.com
language: English
translation: bar.com

-- ds.h2: Checking translation status of the master package

You can check the translation status of the various `official` translations of 
your package by using the `fpm translation-status` command. For a `master` 
package, it returns a global view across all the translations

-- ds.code: `master` fpm translation-status
lang: shell

\$/foo.com/> fpm translation-status

Status for `bar.com` package:
Never marked: 2
Missing: 2
Out-dated: 0
Up to date: 2

-- ds.h2: Making further changes in your `master` package

Making any changes in your master repo once the translation package has been 
synchronized will lead to that particular document in the `translation` package
getting downgraded to `Out-dated`.

-- ds.code: Make some changes
lang: shell

\$/foo.com/> echo "\n-- dsd.text: Hello World" >> example01.dsd

\$/foo.com/> fpm sync

Repo for foo.com is github, directly syncing with .history.
example01.dsd

-- ds.markdown:

Once this package is deployed, the next time we run `fpm translation-status` in 
context of the `translation` package(/bar.com/), we should see the `Out-dated`
document status

-- ds.code: `bar.com` translation-status
lang: shell

\$/bar.com/> fpm translation-status

Never marked: FPM.dsd
Out-dated: example01.md
Up to date: example02.dsd
Never marked: example03.dsd
Missing: example04.dsd
Missing: example05.dsd
