-- my-ds.page: Publishing Static Site On github pages

Easiest way to get started with `fastn` is using the github pages to host your
built assets.

-- cbox.warning: You Lose Many Dynamic Features In Static Modes

FASTN comes with a lot of dynamic features, which are only available when you are
using [fastn server](/server/) for hosting.

The main feature you will miss when using fastn as static site generator is
authentication, you can not create private fastn sites, or fastn sites with mixed
mode, some pages public and some accessible to only few people.

-- ds.h1: Using the template repository

You can use our template repository [fastn-blog](https://github.com/fifthtry/fastn-blog/)
to create your own repo.

-- ds.h2: Step 1: Creating your own repo

Open the [fastn-blog](https://github.com/fifthtry/fastn-blog/) repository in your
browser and click on the `Use this template` button

-- ds.h2: Step 2: Updating the configs in repository

In order to use the package properly, you'll need to make the following changes
in your codebase.

-- ds.code: FASTN.ftd
lang: ftd

\-- import: fastn

\-- fastn.package: <username_or_orgname>.github.io/<repo_name>
zip: github.com/<username_or_orgname>/<repo_name>/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

\-- fastn.dependency: fifthtry.github.io/blog-theme

-- ds.h2: Step 3: Activate the `Github Pages` environment on your repo

In your repository, go to `Settings > Pages` to access the `Github Pages` admin
section.

Choose the `build` branch in the dropdown and in the directory dropdown, choose
`/(root)` and click on Save.
