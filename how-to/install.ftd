-- ds.page: Install `fastn`

`fastn` is compatible with various operating systems, including Windows, MacOS,
and Linux.

There are three options available for installation on each system:

1. Using a `pre-built binary`
2. Installing with `cargo`
3. Building from `github repo source`


-- cbox.info: Our Recommendation

We recommend you to install `fastn` through `pre-built binary`.

This is the preferred method as it only requires downloading the binary and
installing it on your local system.

-- ds.markdown: 

`fastn` is written using `rust` language, if you are familiar with it and want
to use `fastn` for your project or for experimentation, you can do it with
other two options, i.e, by installing it using `cargo` or by building the
`source`.

Based on your machine and your choice of installation, you can select one of the
following options:
