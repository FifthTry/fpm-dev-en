-- ft.h0: Building Dark-Mode Switcher Using FTD

In this tutorial we are going to design dark mode switcher from scratch.

-- ft.h1: A Discussion on UI

Many Dark Mode switchers act as toggle switches, they let user switch from one
state, dark-mode, to another, light mode:

-- dark-mode-toggle:






-- ftd.column dark-mode-toggle:
boolean dark-mode: true
width: fill
margin-bottom: 15
padding: 10
border-width: 1
border-radius: 5
background-color if $dark-mode: #8B8000
background-color: yellow

--- ftd.row:
spacing: 5
align: right

--- ftd.text: Dark Mode:
color if $dark-mode: white
color: black
move-down: 5
$event-click$: toggle $dark-mode

--- ftd.text: ðŸŒ™
if: $dark-mode
move-up: 2
$event-click$: toggle $dark-mode

--- ftd.text: ðŸŒž
if: not $dark-mode
scale: 1.2
$event-click$: toggle $dark-mode

--- container: ftd.main

--- ftd.row:
boolean dark-mode: true
border-bottom-radius: 5
width: fill

--- ftd.text:
color if $dark-mode: white
color: black

This is some text to show you dark mode. Try clicking on the ðŸŒ™ / ðŸŒž above.

This is a common pattern, you will find that kind of dark mode toggle in many
website.

-- ft.h2: Two State vs Three State Logic

Today operating system have also started supporting dark mode. The dark mode
switcher, the UI that we are building in this tutorial {ft.highlight: should
ideally not exist at all}. Every site that supports dark mode should simply
honor the operating system preferences set by the user.

-- ft.image:
src: images/dark-mode-preferences.png
width: fill

From the Help in the OSX Preferences:

> Auto gradually adjusts the appearance from light to dark throughout the day.

We should honor the operating system preferences because then user gets a more
coherent desktop environment. All apps use dark mode or none do. Also operating
systems give more advanced control, for example automatic switching to dark mode
based on ambient lighting, or based on time of the day. You would not expect
every website to create such complex logic, doing so based on time of day is
slightly simpler, you only have to worry about finding user's time zone reliable,
account for daylight saving etc, but ambient light detection is hard problem and
requires access to webcam etc, which nobody would give access too!

One can argue the only purpose of the manual switcher in websites that do
support it is show off that this supports it, and maybe given people who love to
fiddle things yet another fidget spinner. Or maybe it signals as a reminder to
end users that we have this feature, see we care about you, or maybe see this is
yet another reason we are cooler than our "enterprise" competitor. For
developers of the site it acts as a debug tool, and should ideally be relegated
to Browser Developer Tools.

Dark mode support, good, I personally find it a major readability improvement,
especially in the night. Dark mode switcher? Not needed as much as current trend
shows.

So if OS is better at switching things, should sites have switcher? This is up to
product managers to decide. But if someone was to ask if they have to have
switcher, how should switcher act? For this question the two state switcher is
almost definitely a bad idea and should never be used, over a three state
switcher:


-- dark-mode-tri-state:

-- ftd.column dark-mode-tri-state:
boolean dark-mode: true
boolean open: false
width: fill
margin-bottom: 15
padding: 10
border-width: 1
border-radius: 5
background-color if $dark-mode: #8B8000
background-color: yellow

--- ftd.row:
spacing: 5
align: right

--- ftd.text: Dark Mode:
color if $dark-mode: white
color: black
move-down: 5
$event-click$: toggle $open

--- ftd.text: ðŸŒ™
if: $dark-mode
move-up: 2
$event-click$: toggle $open

--- ftd.text: ðŸŒž
if: not $dark-mode
scale: 1.2
$event-click$: toggle $open

--- ftd.column:
if: $open
background-color: white
width: 100
border-width: 1
border-radius: 4
anchor: parent
position: bottom

--- t: ðŸŒ™ Dark
$event-click$: $dark-mode=true
$event-click$: $open=false


--- t: ðŸŒž Light
$event-click$: $dark-mode=false
$event-click$: $open=false

--- t: ðŸ’» System
$event-click$: $open=false

--- container: ftd.main

--- ftd.row:
boolean dark-mode: true
border-bottom-radius: 5
width: fill

--- ftd.text:
color if $dark-mode: white
color: black

This is some text to show you dark mode. Try clicking on the ðŸŒ™ / ðŸŒž above.

-- ft.markdown:

Here we do not yet have "System" working. Clicking on that item simply closes
the dropdown.

-- ftd.text t: $text
caption text:
width: fill
padding-horizontal: 10
padding-vertical: 5
background-color if $MOUSE-IN: #f2f2f2
