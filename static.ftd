-- ds.page: `fpm`: Static Site Generator

`fpm` packages can be converted to static websites that can be hosted by any
static hosting service like Github, Vercel etc.

-- cbox.warning: You Lose Many Dynamic Features In Static Modes

FPM comes with a lot of dynamic features, which are only available when you are
using [fpm server](/server/) for hosting.

The main feature you will miss when using fpm as static site generator is
authentication, you can not create private fpm sites, or fpm sites with mixed
mode, some pages public and some accessible to only few people.
