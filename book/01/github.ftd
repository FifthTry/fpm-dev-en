-- my-ds.page: Hello, Github! ðŸš§

Github is an online collaboration platform, where developers come together and
write software. Github is not the only one, there is Gitlab, BitBucket and a
few others. Or you can even run your own code collaboration platform, after all
that's what software developers do, they are not bound by other companies to
provide the solutions for their need, but can build our own. Among these, Github
is kind of the most popular one, and there is no harm in learning, so even if you
did not end up using Github, the same basic ideas will apply.

So Github, Github uses something called `git` underneath. `git` is the real
brain, and Github is kind of on top of it. In fact the others I mentioned,
Gitlab, BitBucket too support `git`, so as you see if you learn `git`, you can
use any of these.

So you have to learn both `git` and Github if you want to do programming. And
we will, very gradually, over the course of this book.

-- ds.h1: Why Don't People Write Code In Google Docs/Dropbox etc?

A lot of early programmers ask this question. After all Google Docs, and Apple
Notes, etc are great at collaboration. Of course Google Docs does not store
program files, which are plain text files, but they have, a proprietory "rich
text format", same with Apple Notes etc.

But how about Dropbox, Google Cloud, iCloud etc? They let you store files,
including plain text files, and sync them across different machines. Even
support sharing folders with multiple users, so any number of people can work
on the same set of files.

Why do we need these more complex `git` and Github at all?

It is all about conflicts. See if you share some files among people. Or even if
you are the only one editing those files, but if you are editing those files
from different devices, say you have a laptop and a desktop. Or since you are
going to develop software, which is going to "get deployed on SERVER", you are
going to have more than one device or more than user editing those files. This
is kind of unavoidable. And if there are going to be more than one devices or
users, there is going to be conflicts.
