-- my-ds.page: Edit Your Site ðŸš§

So you have a [Github account](/book/github/), [a repo](/book/repo/), which
you [published on Github Pages](/book/gh-pages/). You also learnt [how to
launch Codespaces, install `fastn` on it, and run your site there](/book/codespaces/).

In this section you will modify your site a little bit, preview the changes, and
once satisfied, create a "commit", and "push" your change back to your
repository. You will then verify that the [Github Actions we mentioned
earlier](/book/gh-pages/#github-actions) pick your commit, and publish your
updated website.

-- ds.h1: Edit Your Site

This is how your codespace looked like at the end of the last section:

-- ds.image:
src: $assets.files.book.images.preview-in-editor.png

The `index.ftd` file is open in the left editor pane, and the preview of your
site is open in the "Simple Browser" on the right. The most important thing to
note is that the `index.ftd` file is the source code of what you see on the
right, in the preview browser, which is your website. If you want to modify
your website, you have to modify `index.ftd` (and possibly other files).

In this section we would not yet go into details of the content of `index.ftd`,
but do give it a read, and try to find correspondence between what you see in
`index.ftd` file and what you see in the preview. For example in the line number
5 we have:

-- ds.code: line number 5 of `index.ftd`
lang: ftd

\-- ds.page: Welcome to your [FASTN site](https://fastn.dev/)

-- ds.markdown:

Which is the big text in the preview.

Let's edit that line and make it read:

-- ds.code: edited line number 5 of `index.ftd`
lang: ftd

\-- ds.page: Yo, hello there!

-- ds.markdown:

Once you edit the file, you have to reload the preview browser:

-- ds.image: The third box is for reload
src: $assets.files.book.images.reload.png

Once you reload, the message will change:

-- ds.image: The site is changed
src: $assets.files.book.images.updated.png

There you go.

-- ds.h1: All That For A Line Of Change?

Before we proceed let's take a pause and review. A lot of people ask why is all
this necessary? All we did was change the text of the heading. Could we not
have changed the heading by clicking on it? If you use Google Docs, Notion,
Word, Figma, Wix etc you must be used to just clicking on what you want to edit
and editing it.

While that can be done, ask yourself some questions, like should it be a single
click or a double click? While you are editing the title can you also change
the color? Do you get color picker? While you are editing, do you press Enter
to accept the change or Escape key? Who decides all these? What if you do not
like the decisions done by that team?

Programming let's us build the user interfaces where people can click and edit.
If we do not learn programming we would be consumers of others who know
programming. We will have to pay the price they ask.

Programming itself can be made easier, and at the most fundamental this is what
`ftd` and `fastn` are about, making programming easy for everyone. But
programming is unavoidable. The more our lives become digital, the more
software we need.

So yes, the change was small, but you did it. You used all the tools, and in the
manner professional programmers do it, and it was not that hard. You will learn
to make bigger changes.


-- ds.h1: Let's Review Our Change

So you have edited the line number 5 of the file `index.ftd`. Or maybe you went
on your own and made more changes in `index.ftd`. Or maybe you edited other
files as well. Your repository is small, it is just starting, but it will
become bigger with time. So how do we see the changes?

Also the changes you have done are so far only in your codespace. If you go look
at your repository, eg `github.com/<username>/<repo-name>`, you will see that
there are still only two commits, and `index.ftd` is still showing the old
message.

So you have made changes in a copy of your original repository content. How to
send these changes back to the repository?

The first question is what have you modified? You can rely on your memory, "oh I
just modified 1 line in `index.ftd`", but memory is sometimes unreliable. Also
you may have done some accidental changes without realising. We have a better
way.

Let's switch back to our terminal.
