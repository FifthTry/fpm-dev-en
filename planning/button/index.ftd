Hey Guys, Welcome to the video where we are going to create a button using
`fastn`. 
We will do it by creating a component and at first we are going to use only 
the required properties to it.

Script

We have taken inspiration to create a UI similar to what you can see. I found
this UI of button in Vercel. In this video we will create a basic button that
displays just the text and give a url to these buttons.

In the next video, we will polish the UI and try to re-create similar UI.


-- ds.h2: Basic UI

Script

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Let's start creating the button using the component.
=======
Let's start by creating a `component` called `button`.
The syntax is:

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- component button:

\-- end: button

-- ds.markdown:

We will give the basic properties to this component like, `title` and `link`.
`title` will be of `caption` type. 
`link` is of `string` type.

You can also make the link as `optional`, if you do not want to add any link to
it.

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- component button:
caption title:
optional string link: 

\-- end: button

First, let's create a button.

Inside this component we will add `ftd.text` that will take the title and other
properties.

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.text: $button.title
link: $button.link
border-width.px: 2


-- ds.markdown:

We have a basic button ready.

Now let's give some styling properties 

So, in the component definition we will add:

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- component button:
caption title:
optional string link: 
ftd.responsive-type role: $inherited.types.copy-regular ;; <hl>
ftd.color text-color: $inherited.colors.text-strong 	;; <hl>


\-- end: button


In the `ftd.text`, we will use these component properties.

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- ftd.text: $button.title
link: $button.link
border-width.px: 2
role: $button.role 			;; <hl>
color: $button.text-color 	;; <hl>
style: bold 				;; <hl>
>>>>>>> Stashed changes


;; create the component



-- ds.h2: Done

There you go, we have created a button. You have choice to go and create your
own amazing UIs over this button or if you want to re-create the button I am
creating, you can watch the next video. 




-- ds.h1: Part 2 - Polishing UI

In this part we will polish the UI to re-create the button.

-- ds.h2: Intro Clip

Screen: Introduction slide

Welcome back, let's jump straight into adding properties and create variables
to polish the UI.

We will use the concepts of <so and so>


-- ds.h2: Done

So we have polished the UI. I hope you have learnt with me and found this video
easy to follow. You can share your feedbacks if you wish to.

We would love to see your package. Checkout our "show-and-tell"
channel on Discord where you can share with us your own UIs and I can also
create a video to show who has created what.
