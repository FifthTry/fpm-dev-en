-- ft.page: syncglossary

An FPM sync Glossary

-- ft.h2: client project

An [fpm project](glossary/sync/#fpm-project) which is a clone to the
[server project](glossary/sync/#server-project) and tracks it. The interaction
with server project is established using [sync](glossary/sync/#sync).


-- ft.h2: clone

Clone a [server project](glossary/sync/#server-project) into a new directory
which becomes [client](glossary/sync/#server-project)


-- ft.h2: conflict-state

The file is said to be in the `conflict-state` if the file gets in conflict with
server latest [version](glossary/sync/#version) of the same file.

```
The file, in conflict-state, is never considered to be synced unless its
conflict is resolved.
```

-- ft.h2: fpm project

The unit folder that contains `FPM.ftd` and any number of folders or files of
any extension along with states (server-state and/or client-state).


-- ft.h2: server project

An fpm project which is used to track the same project but resides somewhere
else. To communicate with server, see [clone](glossary/sync/#clone) or
[sync](glossary/sync/#sync).


-- ft.h2: sync

To bring the contents of [client project](glossary/sync/#client-project) into
the [server project](glossary/sync/#server-project). Also to bring the server's
changes after the client diverged into the client project. In the end results
the server and the client to be exact copy of each other.

Sync is specific to a file. Though the [`fpm sync`](cli/fpm-sync/) commands
results in syncing of all the changed file.

Syncing is performed by an automatic process that identifies changes made since
the client and the server diverged, and then applies all those changes together.
In cases where changes conflict in the file, file enters into conflict-state and
manual intervention may be required to complete the sync of conflicted file.

A successful sync results in the creation of a new [version](glossary/sync/#version)
of the file.


-- ft.h2: Three-way merge

Three-way merges use a dedicated [version](glossary/sync/#version), also known
as base version, to tie together the histories in server and [un-synced
file](glossary/sync/#un-synced-file) in client. FPM uses three state of file to
generate the new version: first: latest version in server, second: un-synced
file in client and third: their common ancestor version.


-- ft.h2: un-synced file

The changes in the file that resides in the [client
project](glossary/sync/#client-project) and are not yet [sync](glossary/sync/#sync)ed.

-- ft.h2: version

As a noun: A single point in the FPM project history of a file; the entire
history of a file in a project is represented as a set of interrelated version.

As a verb: The action of storing a new snapshot of the fileâ€™s state in the
[fpm project](glossary/sync/#fpm-project) history, by creating a new version
representing the current state of the file. The new version is created by
[sync](glossary/sync/#sync) action.
