Welcome!! My name is Ajit

In this video we learn how to create a webpage in fastn using doc-site

-- ds.image:
if: { show-planning }
src: $fastn-assets.files.expander.ds.img.page-intro.png

-- ds.h1: Introduction

We have this component in `doc-site`. 

-- ds.code: Page component
lang: ftd

\-- ds.page:

\;; content goes here

\-- end: ds.page

-- ds.markdown:

To use the component you have to add the package to your project.

To add the `doc-site` package to your project:

**A:** Add it as a dependency in `FASTN.ftd` document.

-- ds.code: Add as dependency
lang: ftd

\-- fastn.dependency: fastn-community.github.io/doc-site

-- ds.markdown:

**B:**  Then, import the `doc-site` package in your documents like `index.ftd`

-- ds.code: Importing doc-site
lang: ftd

\-- import: fastn-community.github.io/doc-site as ds

-- ds.markdown:
if: { show-planning }

And we have given a shorter alias to this package `as ds`.

$on-global-key[alt-p]$: $ftd.toggle($a = $show-planning)

With this container component `page`, you can effortlessly construct web pages
by seamlessly integrating various components within this single container.


-- ds.code: Page
lang: ftd

\-- ds.page: You meet me first because I am ~in~ en'titled ü§¥
site-name: Ajit
site-logo: $assets.files.images.logo.svg
logo-width: 50
site-url: https://fastn.com/


Hello, I am the first paragraph in the body area üñê. 

And I am the second paragraph üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è in the body area of the page component. 

At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio 
dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis molestias excepturi sint occaecati 
cupiditate non provident.


\-- ds.h1: I'm the tallest in my family ü¶ï

This is heading level 1 optional body content.

\-- ds.h2: Damn! I just missed by few pixels üê™

This is heading level 2 optional body content.

\-- ds.h3: I get bullied by the above two üôÑ

This is heading level 3 optional body content.

\-- ds.markdown:

I don't brag about myself but I am the convient one üòé.


\-- end: ds.page

-- ds.markdown: 

We will learn how to add and change color schemes and typography in the 
upcoming videos.

Let's view it in the browser. Since we are giving a `site-logo` that has a file
from this package, let's first import assets.


This is how the page looks with default color-scheme and typography. We have the
site logo and site name at the top left along with the site-url which you can
see at the bottom-left, when I hover the mouse pointer on logo.

We have the entitled title, along with other data.

-- ds.h3: Benefits
if: { show-planning }

The component `page` has various benefits:

From harmonizing *color schemes*, *site logo* and *name* to selecting 
compelling typography, you can effortlessly infuse your website with a unified 
and professional look.

`Page` has some properties that easily add meta-data and hence unlock the 
potential of SEO optimization and boost your website's visibility and ranking. 
There is a separate video dedicated to the same, you can find the link in 
the description.

-- ds.h1: Customized Page Component

Now imagine, you have a dozen of such documents in your package. 

On top of it, imagine displaying your distinctive site logo and site name 
across the website, creating a unified visual identity that resonates with 
your brand. It would be a tedious job applying the same properties to all the 
documents.

Also, in the future, if you add new properties or change one or more values of
the properties, then you would need to manually update it on all the pages.

To maintain a consistent brand image across the pages throughout the website,
and make it easy to update with a single change, we can create a custom page
component. This component can include the site logo, site name, color scheme, 
and typography, along with other properties, sparing us the need to apply 
them individually to each and every page.

To do the same, we will move the component definition in a separate document, 
let's call it `my-ds.ftd`.

And create our custom component:

-- ds.code: my-ds
lang: ftd

\-- component page:
optional caption title:
optional body body:
children wrapper:

\-- ds.page: $page.title
body: $page.body
site-name: Ajit
site-logo: $assets.files.images.logo.svg
site-url: https://fastn.com/

\-- end: ds.page

\-- end: page


-- ds.markdown:

Now as we know we are going to use the `doc-site` package and `my-ds` in all 
or most of the documents, therefore we can auto-import them. 


-- ds.code: my-ds
lang: ftd

\-- fastn.auto-import: fastn-community.github.io/doc-site as ds
\-- fastn.auto-import: <package-name>/my-ds as my-ds


-- ds.markdown:

Now we can use the component in the my-ds document without worrying about
missing out on any property. So we get the brand identity across our
documentation.

/-- ds.rendered.input:

Therefore, we can safely say, the `page` component offers as a powerful tool 
for all kind of documentation without restrictions.
