-- ft.page: Local Identity for Testing

Since identity requires people to sign in, and that may happen via oauth etc,
local development can become a pain, so we use a local identity feature, only
for testing.

-- ft.h1: When Would This Feature Work

For safety this will only happen if fpm serve is listening on 127.0.0.1. Also it will not
happen if [HOST key feature](https://github.com/FifthTry/fpm/issues/204) is
being used.

-- ft.h1: How to Use Local Identity

This feature can be used on a per request basis using `identity` cookie, or
globally via `--identity` cli argument to `fpm serve`.

-- ft.h2: `identity` cookie

If a cookie named `identity` is present which can contain comma separated list
of `email: amitu, github: amitu` etc.

-- ft.h2: `--identity` cli parameter

When launching fpm server we can also specify
`fpm serve --identity="email: amitu, github: amitu"`, if so every request will
be assumed to have this identity.

-- ft.h2: What to do if both are passed?

If the server started `--identity` and `identity` cookie is found, so we will prefer cli `--identity` cookie and ignore other.
