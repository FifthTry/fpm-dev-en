-- ft.page: How Sync Works

We have two states, "server state" and "client state".

-- ft.h1: Server state

The server state is stored inside the `.server-state` folder. It comprises all
files' history.

-- ft.code: `.server-state/history.ftd`
lang: ftd

\-- record server-state:
file-history list history:



-- ft.h2: History

File history captures every modification to a file. It also included information
about changes that happened due to merges, if an action happened to the "main
branch" via merge from a CR, we store the CR where the change came from in the
`src-cr` field.


-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- record file-history:
caption filename:
file-edit list history:

\-- record file-edit:
caption or body message:
integer timestamp:
integer version:
optional string author:
option integer src-cr:
string operation:


-- ft.markdown:

Actual content is stored in the file system based on
`.server-state/<file-name-without-last-extension>.<version>.<extension>`.

Also, the version number starts with 1 for every file, and is incremented by
one for every change in that file. Delete also increments the version number.




-- ft.h1: Client state

On the client, the state is largely two: workspace content and the unsynced
tracking information.


-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- record client-state:
workspace-entry list workspace:

\-- record workspace-entry:
caption filename:
optional boolean deleted:
integer version:

-- ft.markdown:

Client state is stored in `.client-state` folder. Workspace information is
stored in `.client-state/workspace.ftd`.



-- ft.h1: Sync Scenarios

Given the current server and client state, a bunch of operations are there,
which either print some output or update either the client or server state.

-- ft.h2: A file was updated locally, no changes on remote

We detect a file is updated locally by finding the version for every file in
`workspace.ftd`, and then comparing the local file with the
`.history/<filename>.<version>.<ext>`. If the content is different file is
considered modified.

Say file is file.ftd, and its current version on server is v1. On sync server
will get file.ftd, v1 and new content of file. Server sees their version is also
v1, so server computes v2, and stored the new content of the file.

Server returns latest `file.v2.ftd` content, and client stores it in
`.server-state`, and updates the `.client-state/workspace.ftd` and `file.ftd`
in workspace.


-- ft.h2: A file was updated locally, with non conflicting changes on server

If `file.ftd` was modified by someone else in the meanwhile, and the server
state has already moved to v2, server does a three way merge between v1 version
of file.ftd as "base", and v2 as "theirs" and the current content as "ours".

In non conflicting state the file content is simply updated. Server computes
a v3, and returns the merged content to client, client adds it to .server-state
folder, and updates the workspace.ftd and file.ftd's content in the workspace.


-- ft.h2: A file was updated locally with conflicting changes on server

If on server, v2 and our changes do not merge cleanly with v1 version as based,
server notifies the client that the sync for that file failed. Server sends the
v2 version of file which client stored in `.server-state` folder. `workspace.ftd`
and `file.ftd` in workspace are not modified.


-- ft.h2: Only a file with no known conflicts are sent to server

Before sending a file we check if the file has known conflict. To do this we
use the version in `workspace.ftd` and the content of `file.ftd` for that
version as "base", and the latest version of `file.ftd` in `.server-state` as
"theirs", and the content of `file.ftd` in the workspace as "ours" and perform
three way merge, and if the merge fails, we know there is conflict.


-- ft.h2: Deleting a file, no edits on server case

If a file is deleted from workspace and if [`fpm rm <file>`](/cli/rm/) command has been run,
this sets deleted in `workspace.ftd` entry, we send this information to server
on `fpm sync`, and our version number. Server will see our version numbers match,
so server will create a new version number to mark deletion of the file, and
update the `.server-state/history.ftd`. And the client will delete the entry
from `.client-state/workspace.ftd`.


-- ft.h2: Deleted by us, edited on server

If the file we deleted has been updated on server, server will see different
version number, and return a conflict message along with the latest content of
the file. Our conflict detector will spot that we have deleted a file
corresponding to a version number in workspace.ftd that is no longer the latest
version of that file, and treat is as conflict and not send it to server on next
fpm sync.



-- ft.h2: Edited by us, deleted on server

Server again see two different version numbers, on delete we increase the
version number, and reject the changes, as delete and edit are not cleanly
merge-abe using three way merge operation.

Client will show the conflict message
