-- ft.page: How to Use Favicon

-- ft.markdown:

There are two ways by which you can use favicon:

* Either pass the path to your favicon file as header under fpm.package in FPM.ftd.
This favicon path should be relative to the root package folder.

-- ft.code:
lang: ftd

\-- fpm.package: some-package-name
favicon: path/to/your/favicon.*

-- ft.markdown:

* Or just put a favicon.* file in the root package folder which will be picked up by default.

## Favicon.* conflict
In case of multiple favicon.* files in the same package folder,
then the favicon file will be selected in the priority order `ico > svg > png > jpg`.
