-- ft.page: FPM Controller Support

FPM cli supports communication with [fpm
controller](https://github.com/FifthTry/fpm-controller). This is an optional
feature, and is only available when `controller` feature is enabled, which is
not enabled by default.

-- ft.h1: Controller Communication

When `controller` feature is enabled, `fpm serve` will first communicate with
the FPM controller service's `/get-zip/` API.

-- ft.h2: FPM Controller Service Endpoint

The FPM Controller Service's enpoint is computed by using environement
variable `FPM_CONTROLLER`, which will look something like this:
`https://controller.fifthtry.com`, with the API path.

FPM Controller Service has more than one APIs: /get-package/ and /fpm-ready/.

-- ft.h1: `/get-package/`

Through an environemnt variable `FPM_INSTANCE_ID`, the `fpm serve` will learn
it's `instance id`, and it will pass the instance id to the `get-package` API.

The API returns the URL of the package to be downloaded, git repository URL and 
the package name.

FPM will download the zip file and unzip it in current directory. The current
directory will contain `FPM.ftd` and other files of the package.

The API will respond with the latest commit SHA as the response.

FPM will then calls [`fpm install`](/cli/install/) on it.

-- ft.h1: `/fpm-ready/`

Once dependencies are ready `fpm` calls `/fpm-ready/` API on the controller. The
API will return with success, and once it is done fpm will start receiving HTTP
traffic from the controller service.
