-- ft.page: User Identity

A fpm package can limit who has read or write access. We do it by storing
[user groups](/dev/user-group/) in [sitemap](/sitemap/). An `identity
group` contains one or more `user identity`.

-- ft.h1: What is User Identity?

In many systems that implement authentication and ACL, users are identified by
username on that system, or user-id.

We allow multiple identities. People who are collaborating may know you by
different identities, and we are not trying to create our own user-id/username
system.

To identify another person, someone may use their email address. They may use
their phone number. Or maybe their github or twitter username.

Similarly a person may not be interested in giving access to an individual but
to a group of users, and the group may be identified by say everyone who has
a `@fifthtry.com` email address, or everyone who is part of a Discord Server,
or a Channel on discord. Or everyone who is part of a team on Github, or who has
commit access to some repo and so on.

All these are called user identities. Example identities:
"email: amitu@fifthtry.com", "phone: +1-555-123123", `twitter: amitu`,
`github: amitu`, `telegram: fifthtry`, `telegram-group: fossunited` and so on.

All these strings are now known as `user identity`.


-- ft.h1: Normal vs Special Identities

Some identities are `normal identities` and some identites are `special identities`.

Identites that uniquely identifies individuals are `normal identities` and eg. 
`github: amitu` or `email: amitu@fifthtry.com`.

`special identities` are those identities which requires an API call to do 
membership check.
