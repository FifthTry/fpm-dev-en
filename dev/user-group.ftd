-- my-ds.page: User Group

A fastn package can limit who has read or write access. We do it by organising a
set of [user identities](/dev/user-identity/) using `user group` and then using
the `user group` in the [sitemap](/sitemap/).

User groups are defined in any package by using `fastn.user-group`:

-- ds.code: FASTN.ftd
lang: ftd

\-- import: fastn
\-- fastn.package: amitu.com

\-- fastn.user-group: fifthtry-people
title: FifthTry People
email-domain: fifthtry.com
github-team: FifthTry/everyone

Description-Body: This group is for FifthTry People

-- ds.markdown:

This creates a new user-group, whose unique id is `fifthtry-people`.

The `id` of every `user-group` must be unique in a given package.


-- ds.h1: Group Properties

A group have different properties like `id`, `title`, `description` and
identities.

-- ds.h2: `id`

`id` which should be unique for a package

-- ds.h2: `title`

`title` is a optional key in user-group.

-- ds.h2: `description`

`description` is a optional `body` in user-group.

-- ds.h2: Identities

Identities in a user-group contains `email`, `-email`, `group`, `-group`, etc...

-- ds.h3: All Supported Identities

These are all supported identities for [fastn.user-group](/theme/fastn/#user-group).

- `email`
- `-email`
- `domain`
- `-domain`
- `telegram`
- `-telegram`
- `github`
- `-github`
- `github-team`
- `-github-team`
- `discord`
- `-discord`
- `group`
- `-group`


-- ds.h1: How To Create Group with Multiple Identities

In the below group, `email` key can be used multiple times, `-email` means that
`do-not-include-email` and for other identities as well.

-- ds.code: User Group
lang: ftd

\fastn.user-group:
email: abrark@fifthtry.com
-email: amitu@fifthtry.com
email: shobhit@fifthtry.com
discord: abrark#12345
domain: @fifthtry.com
-domain: @foo.com
github: abrark
github-team: abrarnitk/team-a



-- ds.h1: Re-using groups

User groups can be imported from other packages as well.


-- ds.code: FASTN.ftd
lang: ftd

\-- import: fastn
\-- fastn.package: amitu.com/python
\-- fastn.dependency: amitu.com

\-- fastn.user-group: fifthtry-people
group: amitu.com/fifthtry-people
email: gvr@gmail.com

-- ds.markdown:

Here we have created a group "fifthtry-people", by importing the definition from
`amitu.com/fifthtry-people` and we have added another email address to this
group.

We can use `group` as many times as we want, it must refer to a group defined
in another package. To import we have to add the other package as a dependency
first as shown above.

-- ds.h2: Removing Some People When Importing

We can also remove some of the users defined in the group that is being
imported.

-- ds.code: FASTN.ftd
lang: ftd

\-- import: fastn
\-- fastn.package: amitu.com/python
\-- fastn.dependency: amitu.com

\-- fastn.user-group: fifthtry-people
group: amitu.com/fifthtry-people
-email: foo@bar.com
email: gvr@gmail.com
github: abrarnitk

-- ds.markdown:

This will combine all `group` and other group identities, but `except` ones
will be explicitly removed from the combined set.
