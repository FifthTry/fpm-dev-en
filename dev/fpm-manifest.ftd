FPM packages are distributed as zip file. The zip file so far is generated by Github.
The zip file generated by Github is for the entire repository, not for a single folder
inside that repo.

Due to this reason currently we do not support a single Git repo with multiple FPM
packages.

We are planning to start creating the zip file as part of `fpm build` process, in which
case we will still copy the entire content of Github repo, as we do not want to alter
the folder structure, the zip and repo should contain the same folder structure. We will
have some way to avoid copying some files that are in repo but are not needed by FPM, to
avoid such files from getting added to zip.

In such cases, say if repo contains `a/FPM.ftd` and `b/FPM.ftd`, two fpm packages, we
will generate two zip files, one for when building for `a/FPM.ftd` and another for
`b/FPM.ftd`. Along with the repo files, the zip file will also contain
`FPM.manifest.ftd` at root level, which will point to the `FPM.ftd` that is the main
entry point for this package.

This is how the file looks like:
