-- ft.page: Server provisioning workflow

-- ft.h1: AWS Workflow

The system relies on the AWS EC2 instances to run the final client fpm application.

-- ft.h2: EC2 launch template

The Django application uses the [AWS EC2 launch template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html) 
to provision a server and store the configuration in the DB.

-- ft.h2: FPM client server AMI

Once the provisioned, the server boots up the fpm client AMI. Using the systemd 
configuration, the system initializes a background process `fpm serve` which requests
the information from the entry server corresponding to the instance ID.

Once the `fpm` application boots up sucessfully, it publishes the status to the 
entry server and the routing is configured for the same in the entry server.
