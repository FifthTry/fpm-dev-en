-- ds.page: Hello World - `fastn` Hands-On Workshop

This is first step in the [`fastn` Hands On Workshop](/workshop/). In this we
will install fastn on your machine, and run `fastn`.

-- ds.h1: Install `fastn`

`fastn` can be quickly installed on MacOS, Linux and Windows.

-- ds.h2: On Mac/Linux

-- ds.code: Installer Script for Mac/Linux
lang: sh

curl -fsSL https://fastn.com/install.sh | bash

-- ds.markdown:

If you see the Help text of the fastn command, it confirms that `fastn` is
successfully installed.

-- ds.h2: On Windows

- Download the setup named `fastn_setup.exe`
from the [Releases](https://github.com/fastn-stack/fastn/releases/latest) page

- Run the setup and follow the installation steps

- Once the setup is complete, you will have `fastn` installed in your system

To verify, open command prompt and execute the command, `fastn`

successfully installed.


-- ds.h1: Run `fastn`

**Clone the [`workshop`](https://github.com/fastn-stack/workshop) repository**

-- ds.markdown:

- On GitHub, click on the `Code` and copy the HTTPS `.git` URL 
- Open Terminal/command prompt and change the directory to desktop, for easy 
access
- Paste or type the below code to clone the repository

-- ds.code:

git clone https://github.com/fastn-stack/workshop.git

-- ds.markdown:

Now, change the directory to the first folder `01-hello-world` through terminal.

Run the following command to run a local server:

-- ds.code:

fastn serve

-- ds.markdown:

- Copy the URL and run it on your web-browser.

An empty page will be opened as the `index.ftd` is commented out.

-- ds.h1: Update `index.ftd`

- In the [`index.ftd`](https://github.com/fastn-stack/workshop/blob/main/01-hello-world/index.ftd) file, uncomment the line #9

-- ds.image:
src: $fastn-assets.files.images.workshop.uncommented-index.png
width: fill-container

-- ds.mardown:

- Save the file and refresh the browser. You will see the text `Hello World`
  displayed.

With just one line of code in `fastn` you can print a text in the browser.

Go to the [second step](/workshop/add-quote/).
