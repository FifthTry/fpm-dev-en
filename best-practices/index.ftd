-- ds.page: FTD Code Guidelines

The FifthTry team follows standard coding guidelines. These guidelines are
imporant for several reasons:

- **Readability**: Standard guidelines help to ensure that `code is consistent`
    and `easy to read`. This can make it `easier for other developers
    to understand and modify the code`.

- **Maintainability**: Consistent coding practices can make it `easier to
    maintain and update code over time`. When everyone on a team follows the
    same guidelines, it becomes `easier to collaborate` and ensure that changes
    are made in a consistent manner.

- **Efficiency**: These guidelines can help to `reduce the amount of time it
    takes to write and debug code`. When developers know exactly how to format
    code and where to put certain elements, they can write code more quickly
    and with fewer errors.

- **Portability**: Following standard guidelines can make it `easier to port
    code from one platform to another`. When code is written in a consistent
    manner, it is more likely to work across different operating systems and
    environments.

- **Compliance**: Standard coding guidelines can help ensure that code complies
    with industry standards and best practices. This can be important for
    security, performance, and other critical concerns.
